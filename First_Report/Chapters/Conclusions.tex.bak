In many ways, staying profitable in the very dynamic modern economic environment presents enormous challenges for any company, even the well-established ones. Failure to adequately adapt to the changing market environment could have dire consequences for such companies. As seen in the study of the presentations of Domino Printing, ARM and Imagination, these companies relied on a number of factors such as persistent innovation to maintain profitability.  This hypothesis was further buttressed by the study of BT, Intel and Nokia which confirmed the relevance and importance of innovation to a company`s viability.  BT and Intel have maintained their dominance in their respective technology markets and are poised for continued dominance due to their ability to properly adapt to the changing market. However, Nokia on the other hand has seen a downturn in its fortune in the face of a changing mobile phone market mainly due to its inability to adequately innovate its business model to properly address the changing market environment.  This has led to Nokia losing grip of its previously huge market share to now play catch up in an industry it had dominated for years.

The report`s findings also posited that consistent innovation does not simply refer to a company updating its current products as fast as possible. Indeed, while companies could innovate existing products by using technologies, it is not the only option open for adapting to a changing and increasingly competitive market. Rather, innovation goes beyond the improvement of product quality to encompass the entirety of a company's business model and culture.  The right business model enables a company make necessary changes that allow it continue to stay competitive in a given market and even capture new ones.  BT and ARM were presented as companies that have been able to adopt this approach with attendant success as evidenced by their current strong financial positions and dominance within their respective markets. In fact, one of the ethos espoused by John Biggs of ARM during his presentation is that being able to maintain innovativeness is the true skill of doing business in a technical market, although he also admitted that this requires more than just experience and advanced knowledge.  In essence, it could be said that only when an established enterprise fully understands the dynamic requirements and vagaries of its market, would it be able to adequately and consistently deploy innovative methods to achieve optimum profitability.
