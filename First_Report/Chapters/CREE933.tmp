\section{Instruction set} \label{Section:Instruction}

\subsection{Instruction format}\label{Section:Instruction format}
During the project, there were seven types of instructions have been implemented. In the original design, each instruction was composed of 4 bits operand, 3 bits source and destination register address and 8 bits immediate (18 bits in total). \textcolor{red}{As indicated in the picoMIPS architecture diagram ??}, the opcode bits were assigned to the decoder. Source and destination address bits were allocated to general purpose register. Immediate bits were connected to the ALU for immediate arithmetic operation. In this way each instruction could also be used to interact with register. \\
After the improvement, the instruction size was reduced to 11 bits, with only 6 bits Immediate, 3 bits of operand code and 2 bits register address. All Instruction types are summarised in table 1.

\subsection{Control Instruction} \label{SubSection:Control Instruction}

The affine transform does not require any decisions based on the data. Therefore there is no flag needed, neither are the conditional branches. The only necessary control signal is for the handshaking procedure, and it comes from the switch SW8. The function of the control signal is simply allowing the program counter to increment at the correct moment. In this case, instruction WAIT0 and WAIT1 are implemented to wait control value from switch SW8. 
At the end of the affine transform, an absolute jump is essential for returning the processor back to the start. The absolute jump replaces the value of the program counter with last four bits in the instruction, which enables the processor to jump to any step in the program memory. In this project, it only resets the program counter and clear the immediate with 0s’. But meanwhile it accesses the memory location that contains the result of last calculation to illustrate its value on the FPGA LEDs.


\subsection{Arithmetic and register instruction} \label{SubSection:Arithmetic and register instruction}
In order to accomplish an affine transform, at least two kinds of arithmetic are needed: addition and multiplication. In the processor, the corresponding arithmetic instructions were \textit{ADD} and \textit{MUX}. They consist of the operand codes that will deliver operating commands to Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), designated source and destination register addresses. In addition, instruction \textit{ADDI} and \textit{MUXI} were developed for the arithmetic with signed immediate values. The immediate instructions select build-in immediate values rather than the ones from source register. It is very convenient when used in the calculations with matrix constants. No subtract instruction was implemented to reduce the size of the ALU.\\
At the beginning of the affine transform, x1 and y1 values are provided by the switches. The processor needs to read and store them in the certain memory locations. Therefore a store instruction \textit{LOAD} is implemented for this purpose. Since the register will also be accessed in conjunction with other arithmetic instructions, the register addresses are included in those instructions. 
 
	
\section{Program Counter} \label{Program Counter}

%\subsection{BT Group Plc}
Program counter is the simplest sequential logic module in the system. The counter will increment every clock cycle if the increment control signal \textit{PCincr} is high. If the \textit{JUMP} instruction is called, the absolute branch control signal \textit{PCabsbranch} will force the counter to jump to the address given by the instruction. In this case, it would be the start position of the operation. The program counter size was set to 5 bits, so it can count up to 32 instructions. 


\lstset{language=verilog,caption={Testbench for program counter},label=pctest}
\begin{lstlisting}
module pctest;
 parameter Psize = 5;

  #10 PCabsbranch = 0;
  #10 PCincr = 1;

end //initial

endmodule //end of pctest

\end{figure}

The testbench and simulation result of program counter are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:pc} and listing ~\ref{pctest}. At 20ns, the increment control signal PCincr went high so the counter started to count up. At 30ns, PCincr went low so counter stopped counting at the current clock cycle. At 90ns, the testbench simulated a \textit{JUMP} instruction: \textit{PCincr} became low and absoluate branch control signal \textit{PCabsbranch} went high. In this case, the counter loads the address from Branch address \textit{Brachaddr} (0000) and restarts the counting.\\

\section{Program Memory} \label{Program Memory}

Program memory contains a RAM with synchronous read. It uses the address sent by program counter as the input. The address extracts the corresponding instruction inside the memory to the output. All the instructions were decoded in hexadecimal format and stored in the separate hex file \textit{prog.hex}. During the initiation of the program memory, this file was loaded into the program RAM. The program address width and instruction length were acquired for the declaration of the program memory.\\

The testbench codes are demonstrated in listing ~\ref{pmtest}.\\

\begin{lstlisting}

module progtest;
parameter Psize = 5, Isize = 11;

  #10ns  address [Psize-1:0] = 5'h11;
  #10ns  address [Psize-1:0] = 5'h12;

As shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:pm}, when the testbench feed an address to the program memory, the corresponding instruction was extracted at the output. The testbench attempted all the memory address and outputted instructions were verified correct according to the hex file \textit{prog.hex}. \\

\section{Decoder} \label{Decoder}
The decoder was implemented as a combinational logic. It decodes the opcodes, which is the first four bits of the instruction. Eight types of instructions mentioned in the instruction chapter will be read from the program memory and translate into the control signals for ALU, program counter and general purpose register. The decoder also reads the control signal from switch SW[8] on the top level so the instruction \textit{WAIT0} and \textit{WAIT1} can be executed correctly. If an unexpected opcode is provided in the decoder, an error message will display for the debugging. Each opcode was defined in file \textit{opcodes.sv}. So it is easier to recognize and edit during the programming. ALU function control signals were defined in file \textit{alucodes.sv} for the same purpose. This file is also used in Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).\\
 
The opcode part of the decoder code is show in the listing ~\ref{decoder}. Decoder Opcode is shown in listing ~\ref{opcode}.

		\label {fig:DCtest}
\end{figure}

From the simulation results in Figure ~\ref{fig:DCtest}, at 0ns, the program counter does not increment (PCincr = 0) in default state (no opcode). When the opcode is \textit{ WAIT0} (at 10ns) or \textit{WAIT1} (at 30ns), the program counter signal \textit{PCincr} will depend on switch signal \textit{SW}. \\

At 50ns, the opcode is \textit{LOAD}, the "write-to-register" signal \textit{w} and "read-from-switches[7:0]" signal \textit{sel} rise to high. Starting from 60ns, the decoder outputs the ALU control signal according to the arithmetic opcodes, along with the write signal to register. If the arithmetic opcodes involve the immediate value (at 60ns and 80ns, the control signal \textit{imm} will rise to high. The last opcode for the simulation is \textit{JUMP}, therefore the absolute branch signal \textit{PCabsbranch} becomes high.\\

The RTL synthesis is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:decoder}.

\section{General Purpose Register} \label{General Purpose Register}

The general purpose register was implemented as the multiple-port RAM with asynchronous read. It has two register address input ports and two register value output ports. The register to register calculation is greatly benefited from this design. In total there were five registers declared and each register could store one 8 bit data. Different from the program memory, the general purpose register must also be able to restore the data to the designated address. However the register will not record the data only if the “write-to-register” signal \textit{w} from the decoder rises to high. The fifth to seventh bits of the instruction were used as the destination register address. Eighth and tenth bits were the source register address.

The testbench code is shown in listing ~\ref{GDR}.

\lstset{language=verilog,caption={General Purpose Register testbench},label=GDR}
\begin{lstlisting}

  #10ns w =1; Rdno = 3'b001; //write data in register 1
  #10ns w = 0;
  #10ns Wdata = 8'b00001111;
  #10ns w =1; Rdno = 3'b010; //write data in register 2
  #10ns w=0;
  #10ns Rdno = 3'b001;//test Rd
  #10ns Rsno = 3'b010;//test Rs
end
endmodule // module regstest
\end{lstlisting}

		\caption{Simulation results of General Purpose Register}
		\label {fig:GPRtest}
\end{figure}

In the testbench simulation there were two data written in the register 1 and 2 at different time. Because the register has asynchronous read, so the data could be written in and read out during the same clock cycle. At 70ns and 80ns, destination and source addresses were changed, and so were the data output at the destination and source register. This behaviour indicates the correct operation of the general purpose register. \\

However, Altera Cyclone III in FPGA only supports the synchronous memory block. Therefore the RTL synthesis tool have to use plenty of combinational logic units instead of the build-in RAM to create the required register. This results in a large size sequential register with no use of any memory bits, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:register}.\\

\section{Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)} \label{Arithmetic Logic UnitALU}

ALU is a complex combination logic used to execute all the arithmetic operation. It reads ALU operands from general purpose register or immediate bits in the instructions. The ALU function depends on the control opcode \textit{ALUfunc} given by the decoder. In this project, only addition and multiplication were developed in the ALU, and no sign extension was used. The corresponding ALU opcodes were defined as \textit{RADD} and \textit{RMUX} in the file \textit{alucodes.sv}. When ALU is not used, the input operands can pass it by using ALU opcode \textit{RA} and \textit{RB}. \\

In this project, only the integers are involved in the addition. But the matrix coefficients for the multiplication in the affine transform are 2’s complement signed fixed‐point fractions, which have the radix point positioned after the most significant bits. In ALU, the 2’s complement 8‐bit number multiplication yields a 16‐bit result. The fifteenth and eighth bits of the result were extracted in order to represent the correct integer of the calculation, and the fraction part was discarded entirely.  The weight of the leading bit of the truncated representation is considered as \(-2^7\) so both positive and negative number can be correctly represented.

The testbench of ALU is shown in listing ~\ref{ALU}. ALU opcode is shown in listing ~\ref{alucode}.

The testbench simulated Pass-the-ALU, addition and multiplication function with two numbers. Number A was considered as -0.25 for a fractional number or -32 for an integer and B was treated only as 20 for an integer. At the 10ns and 20ns, the ALU was commanded to pass -0.25 and 20 without any calculation. At the 30ns, an addition was executed and -12 was the result of -32 plus 20. At the 40ns, -5 was shown as the result of a multiplication between -0.25 and 20. \\

The RTL synthesis of ALU is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:ALU}. The ALU is quite compact without other redundant arithmetic logics. The multiplier is synthesised as an embedded hardware unit of Altera Cyclone III.

\section{Altera DE0 implementation} \label{Altera DE0 implementation}
A top level picoMIPS CPU module was implemented to encapsulate all sub-level individual modules. The CPU reads ten switches SW [9:0] from FPGA device, and outputs the results directly to the LEDs to save some hardware. Additional multiplexer \textit{imm} selects the data between immediate bits and source register output, and the multiplexer \textit{sel} selects switches [7:0] or ALU output. A simple counter was added to slow down the Altera DE0 embedded 50MHz clock to around 10Hz for the demonstration of the design.\\

The testbench for the complete CPU is shown in listing ~\ref{cputest}. A pixel coordinates [16 20] were used as the example in the simulation.\\

As indicated in Figure ~\ref{fig:ocpu}, the CPU successfully completed the affine transform. In details, at 150ns and 300ns, the WAIT instructions paused the operation until the required switch signal \textit{control (SW[8])} has appeared. The coordinates were correctly loaded into the register with LOAD instruction at 160ns and 310ns. The transform started from 360ns. It was executed by a series of addition and multiplication and output result was checked correct with manual calculation (at 390ns and 440ns).\\

The CPU module was synthesised by software \textit{Quartus II}. It was then programmed into chip EP3C16F484C6 (Cyclone III) on FPGA through the Quartus II programmer. The CPU modules was also re-synthesised using Cyclone IV E as the target to obtain the cost figure. For the FPGA test, the test coordinates were exactly the same as in the testbench. After the algorithm, the LEDs outputted the same results from the testbench, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:fpga}\\

Although the original picoMIPS processor successfully performed the affine transform, the cost figure was unsatisfying high (Figure \ref{fig:cputest}). Therefore it was optimized to reduce the hardware usage, which is also the second goal of this project. The cost figure result shown that general purpose register occupied the most logic units in the design, and long instruction length also enlarge the program counter and memory. Therefore they become the major targets for the optimization.\\
