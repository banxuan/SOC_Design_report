The ever-changing world of business sees companies of different sizes and strengths competing for the dominance of ever-changing, evolving and dynamic markets.  The evolution in particular business environments could be due to any number of reasons such as technological innovations, change in the taste of customers or unfavourable political and socio-cultural factors.  Interestingly, history is replete with examples of companies that were subsumed by changing business environments mostly because they were unable to adapt to a new economic paradigm; a new way of doing things.  Companies like Nokia, Research In Motion (RIM) makers of the Blackberry, Kodak and East India Company are examples of few companies that found themselves on the wrong side of changing markets leading to their significant decline.   Conversely, companies like IBM, Sony, Intel and BT present examples of companies that were able to weather the storm even in the face of very stiff competition and evolution of their traditional industries.

Commerce has existed for thousands of years, arguably since the development of means of communication itself in man`s early history, and fundamentally has not changed as it basically still involves the exchange of goods and services between different parties. One party trades goods or services with the other to mutually benefit both. However the scale of modern day business has changed dramatically, with popular products selling thousands or in some cases millions of units a year. The understanding of factors of production has also evolved with a greater emphasis placed on technical know-how, making the problem of assessing a company`s success no longer a simple measure of the quantity of goods produced or services provided; success is the result of many more factors, some of which a given company has little or no control over, such as a changing business climate.  Furthermore, there is a high correlation between the ability of companies to maintain dominance in a speedily evolving business market and their longevity and continued profitability.  Most companies rely on the adoption of innovative business models and technologies to respond to such changing and dynamic markets.

This report presents an overview of how consistent innovative business models and technological approach enable established companies to not only maintain profitability in the face of increased competition but also in the face of unpredictable business environments.  The primary focus of the report is on established companies which, for the purpose of this report, are defined as companies that ``have existed or done something for a long time and are therefore recognised and generally accepted``, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.  This definition in the context of technology leaves a lot to be desired, as both general acceptance and lifespan of a given technology or product can change dramatically in a relatively short space of time; whereas it may take over 100 years to become established in other industries (i.e. Coca Cola established in 1886), relatively new players can claim dominance of almost an entire market in a fraction of that time (i.e. ARM established in 1990). It is therefore mostly general acceptance that will be used as a base measure of establishment for the purpose of this report. The ability not only to make a single profitable product but to continually and innovatively improve and adapt that product to meet new challenges allows established companies to `make money` across multiple product cycles and thus stay profitable.

As part of this report`s study, a number of established companies are understudied to observe and investigate their use of consistent innovation to not only stay profitable but also maintain dominance.  Section One looks at three established companies - Domino Printing, ARM and Imagination Technology - and explores how they have stayed dominant in their respective markets and industries based on a series of presentations given by their personnels.  Section Two on the other hand presents an overview of how three other established companies - BT, Intel and Nokia - have relied on innovative practises to maintain dominance in their various industries.  This section relies on a number of books, technical reviews by industry experts and company annual reports to ascertain the companies' varied business models and financial positions.  While BT and Intel remain big players in their respective markets, the same is not the case for Nokia which has seen a decline in its dominance of the mobile phone market in the face of stiff competition in recent years.  The Conclusion section summarises the report and draws conclusions on the role played by consistent innovation on the current standings and profitability of these six established companies.
