\section{Overview of invited companies} \label{Section:SectionOne}

\subsection{Domino Printing} \label{SubSection:Domino}
Domino Printing, founded in 1978, is a leading supplier of Inkjet and laser printing products used primarily for the printing of packaging for consumer products. Domino is perhaps the `odd one out' amongst the reviewed companies, with its main business removed from integrated circuit design and its market share not in high-volume consumer devices. However Domino qualifies as established for its prevalence in the packaging industry, providing printing solutions capable of keeping up with modern mass-production techniques. Most recently Domino launched its N610i, an inkjet printing press to rival the established UV flexography (effectively a modernisation of the letter press) in quality but with improved throughput. In this way the company supports the hypothesis that consistent innovation is key to the profitability of established companies.

However Domino's approach to innovation is somewhat less direct than that of ARM and Imagination. These two companies rely on innovation and on an IP (Intellectual Property)-based approach to provide significant increases in performance between product offerings in order to maintain dominance. Domino on the other hand professes that a sizeable proportion of its business is founded on a technology created in the 1950's (referring to inkjet). Domino takes the view that "the future is already here, it just isn't evenly distributed", and it is therefore in the distribution of its core technology that Domino strives to excel. This can be seen in the many applications inkjet technology is applied to across their range of printing products and its adoption in the market. It is very much this innovation in the application of long-standing technology to new or varied problems in addition to its refinement that secures Domino Printing's future profitability and has made it a resilient player in its respective industry.  Furthermore, this innovative business model is also buttressed by its identification of growing global markets especially in emerging markets such as in South America and Asia, the capture of which has transformed Domino into a profitable global player in the printing industry.  


\subsection{ARM} \label{SubSection:ARM}
Although relatively young, founded in only 1990 as a joint venture between Apple Computers, Acorn and VLSI Technology, ARM now holds over 95\% market share in the smart phone industry and over 60\% in embedded (the two largest portions of its business). This huge dominance in its market, as well as its house-hold name, qualifies ARM as an established company. ARM's business model is founded on intellectual property; the Cambridge-based company does not manufacture any of the microprocessors it designs. In fact the intellectual property on offer cannot be put directly to silicon without significant modification. ARM designs microprocessor cores to be used at the center of clients' own system-on-chip (SoC) designs. It can often take years for licensed technology to make it to end users, and it is mainly when a chip containing ARM licensed technology goes into production that the company makes any long-term gain. According to the strategy detailed for investors on the company's annual report***, ARM aims to recoup the research and development cost of a product from selling licences of that product alone. However, as well as a licence fee for access to the technology, ARM receives royalties from each device made once the chip goes into production. In this way the company is able to secure its future profitability by its ability to leverage the market share and production capability of its partners and licensees. 

It may appear that ARM's contribution is a potentially expendable part of the SoC design process. Companies could choose to design their own processor cores from the ground up. Although this may well be an option for the largest multi-nationals, for the vast majority it is simply unaffordable. Despite the length of time taken to integrate an ARM Core into a working product design, the cost of a licence for a core design is dwarfed by the time and vast capital expenditure involved in designing a comparable microprocessor from scratch. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that so long as ARM continues to offer quality microprocessor cores and remain at the forefront of the industry, companies will choose to licence its technology rather than risking the development of an in-house solution. This sits perfectly with the hypothesis that consistent innovation, where innovation in ARM's case is a significant increase in performance and power-efficiency and an IP-based business model, is key to the profitability of established companies, as without its leading edge in the embedded microprocessing industry, licensees may choose to move their business to competing IP purveyors with similar product offerings (such as Imagination technologies discussed in Section \ref{Section:Imagination} below).


\subsection{Imagination Technology}\label{Section:Imagination}
Another relatively young company, founded as VideoLogic in 1985, Imagination has also made its mark in the consumer electronic device market. Imagination Technologies licences its PowerVR graphics and DAB digital radio technology in a similar way to ARM, discussed above. Again, Imagination's prevalence in consumer smart phone and tablet devices, as well as its dominance in the DAB digital radio market (manufacturing their own Pure branded radios) earn's the company its "established" status. It is easy here to draw comparisons between Imagination, also a UK based IP firm, to ARM. Both offer intellectual property for a licensing fee, with royalties paid once a design reaches production. In fact the companies are in direct competition with each other. ARM's Mali line of GPU's (graphics processing unit) competes with Imaginations key offering in the smart phone and tablet industry, its PowerVR line. In addition, Imaginations recent acquisition of MIPS (one of the few architectures supported by the popular Android OS mobile operating system) brings the companies into further overlapping market space. Both can now offer potential licensees an integrated CPU GPU solution, reducing the further development required to produce a working SoC design.

However Imagination is also heavily invested in what it calls the RPU (radio processing unit) market space. It is this technology that powers its in-house Pure digital radio products. The company has been a driving force behind the promotion of digital radio technology, initially operating at a loss to produce its first sub \pounds 100 radio receiver the Evoke-1, in order to establish the technology and its position of dominance in the new market. Imagination now aims to further secure its future profitability by developing a general-purpose RPU, akin to the more popular general purpose processing units (a.k.a the CPU). Imagination recognises the current gap in the the consumer market for a technology capable of communicating over the variety of radio standards consumers have come to expect from their devices (WiFi, Bluetooth and FM radio to name but a few) in a single SoC package. The traditional solution to this problem is to include a dedicated chip for each standard a device is required to meet, a situation which leads to complexity and increased cost.  As a testimony to its commitment to consistent innovation, Imagination aims to address this problem for consumers by providing a simpler,cheaper and seamless solution using its RPU. In this way the company supports the hypothesis that consistent innovation is key to the profitability of established companies.

 
	
\section{Overview of selected companies} \label{Section:SectionTwo}

\subsection{BT Group Plc}
BT is reputed to be the world’s oldest telecommunications company having directly descended from the Electric Telegraph Company; the very first national telecommunications company in the world which was established in 1846 \cite{BT:2006:history}.  Over the years, BT has grown from being a public company to being a wholly private enterprise since 1984 when the UK government privatised BT.  Today, BT is a global enterprise with a market reach extending to over 170 countries.  However, the journey to its current global status was not exactly a smooth one.  With the deregulation of the UK Telecommunications sector in 1984, the industry was opened up to competition.  Thus, from being a government-owned monopoly, BT now had to compete for market share with new entrants into the UK telecommunications sector while at the same time being answerable to its shareholders and investors; in essence, continued profitability was essential to continued survival and dominance.  Interestingly, with the UK being the first European country to deregulate its telecommunications industry, BT was the first privatised telecommunications company forced to deal with new entrants and competitors in its domestic market \cite{van:2008:strategic}.  

To adapt to the new market dynamics and stay ahead of competitors, BT undoubtedly had to resort to new ways of doing things, in other words, innovative ways of doing business and delivering the best customer experience.  This required innovativeness in not only the product offering but crucially also in the business model and improved operations since innovation goes beyond just dealing with customer experiences or improved technologies \cite{tidd:2011:managing, IBM:2008:electronics}.  For example, improved knowledge management techniques enabled companies like BT to adapt internal capabilities faster than the rate of change in the industry both nationally and globally \cite{mcnaughton:2001:market}.  Furthermore, another approach brought about by the increased focus on innovativeness was the increased focus of BT on internationalisation, i.e. its expansion into the global economy.  In a sense, this is similar to the approach of Domino printing in expanding into emerging markets as illustrated in Section \ref{SubSection:Domino}.  This business model saw BT build alliances and even acquisitions \cite{chan:2001:rivalry, gantumur:2007:mergers} in order to gain access to new markets  so as to increase revenue, all aimed at improving its overall position and standing in the telecommunications industry.  This strategy has seen BT metamorphose from a company with the UK business contributing over 96\% of revenue in 1998 \cite{BT:1998:annualreport} to one in which the global operations especially emerging markets now contribute double-digit figures in revenue \cite{BT:2013:annualreport}.****

Another aspect of BT’s response to the increased competitive market was improved product offering, partly driven by the transformation of the telecommunications sector to now include the delivery of integrated systems which include voice, data and video transmission over integrated networks \cite{chan:2001:rivalry}.  The push to deliver improved QoS (Quality of Service) and improved product offerings (and value) to its customers (individual and business) also fuelled strategic acquisitions and alliances such as the formation of Concert – a company formed by BT and AT\&T - aimed at pursuing a local-to-global-to-local network strategy to deliver better value to customers \cite{chan:2001:rivalry}.  This increased focus on different aspects of innovation has enabled BT not only stay competitive globally but also led to impressive financial results which allow it to continue to invest in what it calls “Investing for the future” aimed at ensuring current gains are maintained and improved upon.  

This strategy has also seen BT maintain a healthy annual investment in Research and Development of new products and technologies with the recent set up of BT Sport - which has now signed up more than 2 million customers - a clear example of this strategy \cite{Forbes:2014:OracleVoice}.  BT’s research partnerships with other companies such as Intel and Alcatel-Lucent also ensure it stays at the forefront of current industry technology.  This is further evidenced by BT filing patent applications for 69 inventions in the 2012/2013 financial year to add to its over 4400 portfolio of patents and applications that year \cite{BT:2013:annualreport}. Furthermore, investments in innovations have seen BT improve broadband coverage and speed, transform costs and improve video delivery in recent years \cite{BT:2013:annualreport}.  These improvements have also led to strong financial results in 2013 with BT maintaining the largest market share in the telecommunications sector (Internet and phones) \cite{Ofcom:2014:FastFacts} and increasing earnings per share by 26.6\% and full year dividend by 9.5\% \cite{BT:2013:annualreport}.

\subsection{Nokia}

Nokia is a Finnish communications and information technology multinational corporation. It was once the largest mobile phone producer and advanced telecommunication technology developer.  However, Nokia was not set up as a mobile phone technology company as mobile telecommunications had not yet even been invented when Nokia was founded in 1865.  After World War II, Nokia was involved in many business areas including: paper products, footwear, communications cables, televisions and other consumer electronics. This diversity brought Nokia a lot of fortune but also a huge problem: the bloated company with too many market segments affected the company's future development plans and severely delayed the improvement design of products. Eventually, producing outdated products pushed Nokia into serious financial problems. Fortunately, as an established company, Nokia had enough resources and previous experience to stay relevant in the changing business environment it found itself in. For example, during the 1990s, the rubber, cable and consumer electronics divisions were gradually sold as Nokia continued to divest itself of all of its non-telecommunications businesses.
 
Interestingly, prior to the strategy change, Nokia had already developed many technologies on telecommunication area and merged with several radio communication partners. Those achievements gave Nokia major advantage over its competitors\cite{39} and even led to the production of one of the very first mobile phones \cite{41}.  This new strategy based on innovation further enabled Nokia take advantage of new opportunities and technologies to drive innovation in the mobile telecommunications market. For example, Nokia was one of the first players in the mobile space to recognize that there was a market opportunity in combining a game console and a mobile phone, which many gamers wanted \cite{ngage}.  In the early years of 2000s, Nokia was always one step ahead of competitors in both mobile phone software and hardware development, such as self-developed smartphone operating system Symbian \cite{symbian} and touch screen technology on phone \cite{touchscreen}, long before Apple's IPhone.
 
Apart from leading on the product innovation front, Nokia also focused on other business model related innovations as well, such as investing in new generation mobile network technology like GSM (Global System for Mobile telecommunication). Furthermore, Nokia overhauled its entire logistics operation in the mid-1990s, to make sure the products manufacture speed could meet up with the fast market requirements. These innovations and accomplishments worked to make Nokia the world's largest and dominant mobile phone manufacturer for the 14 consecutive years from 1998 to 2012.

With the solid success in the mobile phone market, Nokia's ambition was set into internet business where there was competition from the likes of Google, Apple and Microsoft.  However, when Apple introduced its first IPhone into the market, Nokia didn't pay enough attention as Apple only owned 8.2\% of smartphone market at that time, while Android only had 3.9\% of the market at the time as well \cite{130}.  From 2007 to 2010, although Nokia still produced the best mobile phone hardware technologies over its rivals, the operating system Symbian was gradually outmatched by iOS and Android. Though Nokia released several improved models of Symbian, the slow innovation on the Symbian system in the face of the superior iOS and Android systems meant Nokia could just not compete adequately. This resulted in Nokia losing almost 30\% of its mobile phone market share and many OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) while Apple and Google on the contrary made extraordinary gains \cite{134}.
 
Eventually Nokia gave up Symbian\cite{5} and allied with Microsoft\cite{135} to compete with Google and Apple. However, despite this new partnership, the new Nokia phone with Window phone OS (Operating System) was still not favoured enough by the public to stop Nokia’s reducing influence and its market share continued to drop. In June 2011, Nokia was replaced by Apple as the world's biggest smartphone designer \cite{145}. Most European franchisers believe that Nokia Windows phones compare less favourably with the Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy.  Statements such as "They are overpriced for what is not an innovative product" and "No one comes into the store and asks for a Windows phone" summarise this perception \cite{156}.
 
Nokia’s example illustrates the invaluable role that product and business model innovation plays in ensuring an established company maintains its competitive edge especially in the face of stiff competition from new entrants. While keeping one step ahead of its rivals undoubtedly contributed greatly to Nokia's early success, its inability to maintain or replicate this approach in the mobile phone market let to its downfall.  Nokia could be said to have been caught out by its inability to innovate in such a way as to deliver products with better user experience than its rivals thus leading to a situation in recent years such as 2012 and 2013 where high investments and expectations have only led to poor and non-commensurate results  \cite{174}.

\subsection{Intel} 
Intel, founded in 1968, is a leading computer processor, chip set and graphics design and manufacturing company. Thanks to its `Intel Inside' marketing campaign and early traction in the PC market, with the advent of IBM's `Personal Computer', Intel has become the largest supplier of x86 architecture processors for desktop, laptop and server devices and dominates the high-performance computing market with over 80\% market share in both consumer devices and servers to this day. It is both the length of time the company has been trading, producing their first microprocessor in 1971 with SRAM and DRAM (static and dynamic random access memory) before that, and the extent of the company's market reach that qualify Intel as an established company.

In an environment where almost all microprocessor designers choose to operate without in-house facilities to commit their designs to Silicon (such as the likes of ARM and Imagination discussed previously), Intel stands out as the one company capable of producing leading IC designs on state-of-the-art Silicon chips. Intel distinguishes itself on making higher quality microprocessors than its competition, and has been working with Silicon transistors since its founding. Intel was founded by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, of Fairchild Semiconductor who coined the famed Moore's law (predicting the sustained increase of transistor density over time).  These two brought with them considerable expertise in the fledging semiconductor industry which allowed Intel make early progress in the sector and to develop a reputation for high-quality manufacturing techniques very early on.

This position of control over both the intellectual property and the state-of-the-art manufacturing processes of their microprocessor designs gave Intel a clear advantage over competitors. They are able to optimise their designs at every stage of the production process, and operate without the added expense of royalties per chip manufactured. This results in unparalleled profit margins on its leading products that undoubtedly drives the company's profitability. That is not to say that Intel has remained unchallenged. The company has faced stiff competition from rival microprocessor design firm AMD, who offer comparable performance at a cheaper price point. Intel was required to employ some very aggressive market strategies to keep AMD from gaining valuable market share, a tactic that cost the company over \$1.2 billion in settlements with AMD before its eventual decline. However a superior product offering coupled with aggressive marketing and adoption of open innovation has allowed Intel to remain dominant in the consumer computing market.

Intel faces new challenges as microprocessor demand shifts towards mobile platforms, and away from `performance at any power cost' computing. ARM has excelled by offering reasonable performance processing cores at very low power consumptions, and has therefore dominated the mobile computing market up to now. However, although maybe slow to react, the Intel design machine has turned its attention to low-power chip design, aiming to improve its standing in the growing server market space (growing as the PC market declines in the advent of cloud computing) and to break into the mobile market and compete with ARM for share in a market that continues to expand. If Intel is able to produce microprocessors of comparable power consumption and with the performance and backwards-compatibility of its current microprocessor offerings it may well be able to erode ARM's near monopoly in the mobile device market. In any case, the company continues to offer year-on-year improvements in both the design and manufacture of its leading CPUs and will remain profitable whilst it continues to do so as posited by its annual report for 2012 which showed its very strong financial position. In this way Intel's business model clearly supports the proposition that its consistent innovation has been key its profitability and continued dominance.
