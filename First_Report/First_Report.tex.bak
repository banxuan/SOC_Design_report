\begin{abstract}
The continued existence of established companies hinges on their continued ability to adequately and properly exploit their respective industries to maintain profitability.  History is replete with established companies that were unable to sustain dominance of market positions in the face of changing market dynamics and increased competition.  This report investigates how established companies rely on consistent innovation to not only maintain dominance of market segments but to also fend off competition from new entrants and maintain profitability.  Importantly, innovation is used here to not only refer to improvements on product quality but expands to include adaptation of business models to meet the needs of changing market paradigms and evolving customer expectations.  Six companies are investigated to validate the hypothesis about the role of innovation to the profitability of established companies.  The history of these companies was explored while the evolution of their business strategies and financial positions were investigated using company annual reports and technical industry reviews by reputable industry and business experts.  The findings show that five of the six surveyed companies adopted innovative business models and product offerings to stay ahead of competition and maintain profitability unlike the other which declined in the face of more innovative competitors.
